Project for the VU course evolutionary computing. The goal is to evolve the weights of a neural network to be able to beat enemies in a video game environment (Evoman).

Evoman is a video game playing framework inspired by Megaman.

A demo can be found here:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqaMjd1E4ZI

The evolutionary algorithm runs in the file "elitism_and_distance.py".
